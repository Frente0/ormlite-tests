This package provides various tests for the Ormlite project.  These tests are not
appropriate for running inside of Ormlite itself because they require database support
that will probably not be available to all developers.  These tests actually contact
mysql, postgres, mssql, and other databases that are available to the author.

For more information, see the online documentation on the home page:

   http://ormlite.com/
